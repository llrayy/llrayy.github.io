            <div class="memory-month" id="month1">Happy 1st monthsary love. I just wanna say thank you for being here for me when I was at my worst and at my best, thank you for making me realize that I am loved by anyone in this world. I'm so glad that I met you in my life, I love you so much darling. I love the way you talk, your cute face, your laugh, everything about you.
                I think about you nonstop, and I always get butterflies whenever we talk. I want to spend my time with you and create new memories each day, I can never get enough of you and your love for me. I love you Julie, really. And I know that you overthink alot, and that's okay. I'm here for you to assure you that I'll always love you whatever comes our way. Being with me isn't easy, because there's alot of misunderstandings between us, but as long as we talk it out together, I'm sure it'll be fine. Although, my love for you increases each day and I'm so blessed to have you in my life. I know sometimes you make me feel sad, but that's apart of a relationship. So don't worry my love, we all make mistakes and I'll always be ready to understand and forgive you because I love you.
                I appreciate your effort to remain calm whenever we have misunderstandings and I'm glad that now I'm yours
